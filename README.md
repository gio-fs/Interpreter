Here's my current implementation of the Lox language by the "Crafting Interpreters" book. 
Added some features like const variables, continue and break inside loops, long instructions (support of 3-byte index for the constants pool), optimized line getter,
dynamic vm stack (very simple, but still) and other small modifications
