Here's my current implementation of the Lox language by the "Crafting Interpreters" book. 
Added some features like arrays, const variables, continue and break inside loops, ternary operator, string interpolation, long instructions (support of 3-byte index for the constants pool), optimized line getter,
dynamic vm stack and call frames (very simple, but still) and other small changes
